# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

1: Install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2: You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`.
3: From the project root directory, run `docker-compose up` to load Anythink's backend and frontend.
If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database. To test this:
4: Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping
5: If the frontend is running and connected to the backend, youâ€™ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register

Just make sure that you run all scripts in the next quests on one of the containers created by `docker-compose up`.  Also, you can use `docker exec` to run commands on a running container.
